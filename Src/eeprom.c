	The provided implementation of the EEPROM emulation firmware runs from the internal 
Flash, thus the access to the Flash will be stalled during operations requiring Flash erase or 
programming (EEPROM initialization, variable update or page erase). As a consequence, 
the application code is not executed and the interrupt cannot be serviced.
This behavior may be acceptable for many applications; however, for applications with real-
time constraints, you need to run the critical processes from the internal RAM.
In this case:
1.     Relocate the vector table in the internal RAM.
2.     Execute all critical code and interrupt service routines from the internal RAM. the 
compiler provides a keyword to declare func
tions as a RAM function; the function is 
copied from the Flash to the RAM at system st
artup just like any initialized variable. It is 
important to note that, for a RAM function, all used variable(s) and called function(s) 
should be within the RAM
